# Optimize_BESS_MILP
**OPTIMIZATION IN QUANTITATIVE MANAGEMENT FINAL PROJECT:** Optimized the operation of an electric vehicle (EV) fleet by using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to schedule the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), aiming to reduce daily electricity costs.

## Project Overview
- **Context:**
An electric vehicle company is equipped with a BESS and is subject to time-of-use electricity rates, which fluctuate throughout the day based on supply and demand dynamics. Hence, The company seeks to minimize their daily electricity cost by optimally deciding when to charge and discharge the BESS. The challenge lies in determining the optimal charging and discharging schedule that aligns with electricity price fluctuations while adhering to technical and operational constraints.

- **Problem:**
The consumer seeks to minimize their daily electricity cost by optimally deciding when to charge and discharge the BESS. The challenge lies in determining the optimal charging and discharging schedule that aligns with electricity price fluctuations while adhering to technical and operational constraints.

## Key Features
- **Optimization Model**: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to optimize BESS scheduling.
- **Cost Reduction**: Demonstrated daily cost savings from $1396.10 to $1313.02
- **Application Interface**: Customizable parameters for diverse EV models.
- **Implementation**: Developed using Python and IBMâ€™s CPLEX solver.
